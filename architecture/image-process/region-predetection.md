We can roughly divide the algorithmic processing flow of a task into three sections:

* section1.Predetect region(s) for better performance;
* section2.Necessary image pre-processing for enhancing image features.
* section3.Task specific related algorithm processing.

Each section may contain several more detailed algorithmic stages, and in this article we discuss Section1 - Region Predetection.
## Section 1 - Region Predetection

There is a fixed and most complete set of workflow in Section1, which ensures that the results of Section1 can be successfully produced.

This section begins with an image from image source Adapter (ISA). Then there are some optional stages to convert the original image to a grayscale image. Whether it will be done, and how it will be done, is determined by the specific configuration of the Dynamsoft Capture Vision (DCV) template. Table 1 lists these parameters and their respective design intents.

Table 1 â€“ Configurable Parameters in Section 1

| **Parameter Name** | **Functionality** | **Status** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ScaleDownThreshold` | To speed up when the input image size is large. | Available | 
| `ColourConversionModes` | To set the conversion from colour to grayscale, which keeps or enhances the features of the region of interest. | Available, Extensible | 
| `GrayscaleTransformationModes` | To emphasize the features of regions of interest with processing of the grayscale image. | Available, Extensible | 
| `RegionPredetectionModes` | To limit the subsequent process sections in certain areas up by detecting the regions of interest automatically. Pre-detection is based on the colour/grayscale distribution of each area. | Available, Extensible | 


As mentioned above, the focus of this section is to reduce the time cost by scaling down or finding out ROIs. It is not essential for most scenarios but would be helpful for some extreme cases.
